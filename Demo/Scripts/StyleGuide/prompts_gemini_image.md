Gemini Image Prompt Templates — Doodle Art (NIKATAM)

Base (paste and fill [COMPOSITION])
"Doodle art, strict stickman. Cream paper (#fff3e0), thin squiggly graphite lines (#0E1012), pencil-like fills on props/shadows, no gradients, no photorealism. [COMPOSITION]. Include 1–2 faint background doodles (window outline, potted plant outline). Mood: lightly comic, relatable. No text/logos. 1920×1080 PNG."

Compositions
- Top/Bottom Rooms (mirrored):
  "Vertical stacked split-screen, TOP room and BOTTOM room, mirrored actions. Each room shows a stickman with a badminton racket lowered after a miss; shuttlecock on floor near wall. Subtle motion lines near wall. TOP looks downward; BOTTOM looks upward. Keep symmetry; minimal props."

- Doodled Phone UI (centered):
  "Centered doodled smartphone frame with soft inner line; large simple cards and chips; minimal icons; high readability; no embedded text beyond UI shapes."

- Side-by-Side Split (contrast):
  "Left panel: solitary action; Right panel: group action preview. Maintain consistent stroke and palette."

Variants
- Aspect: use 1080×1920 (vertical) or 1080×1080 (square) with same composition.
- Stroke weight: 
  "If lines appear too faint, increase stroke to ≈3 px at 1080p while keeping visible wobble."

Quality Notes
- Ensure visible wobble (1–2 px jitter). Keep backgrounds sparse. Avoid baked-in text.
