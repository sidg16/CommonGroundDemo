Video Generator Prompt Templates — Sora / Veo (NIKATAM)

Base Motion Template (fill [SCENE ACTION])
"Doodle animation in strict stickman style. 24fps final, subtle line jitter (1–2px), draw-on-twos feel. Thin squiggly graphite strokes (~2–3px at 1080p), cream paper background (#fff3e0), pencil textures, no gradients, no photoreal elements. Camera minimal (locked/slight drift). Transitions: line-morph or cross-dissolve. [SCENE ACTION]. No baked-in text/logos. 1080p."

Scene Actions
- Badminton Miss (top/bottom):
  "Vertical stacked split-screen. TOP room: stickman misses a shuttle bounce; shuttlecock falls; looks downward. BOTTOM room: mirrored action; looks upward. 1–2 motion lines on walls; faint background doodles (window, plant)."

- Phone UI — Connect:
  "Centered doodled phone frame. Chips pop (‘Badminton’, ‘Yoga’, ‘Tutoring’); badge circle glows. Finger tap triggers modal with two profile cards and a ‘say hi’ button shape. Smooth micro-interactions under 350 ms."

- Flash Micro-Features:
  "Icon strip on cream background: SOS pulse, Lost & Found pin drop, Complaints shake, Noticeboard pin bounce. Snappy timing, clear labels added later in edit (do not bake text)."

Camera/Timing Options
- Keep camera locked or add 2–4% scale push over the shot.
- Motion timing: 300–350 ms for UI pops; 500–700 ms for line-morph transitions.

Audio Guidance (for editor)
- Keep outputs silent; add VO/SFX in post. Align accents to motion cues.
