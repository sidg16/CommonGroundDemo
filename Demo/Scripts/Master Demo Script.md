NIKATAM — Demo Video Master Script (60s, frame-by-frame)

Purpose: Single 60-second validation/demo video for early adopter signups. Ready to feed to AI video generators (Sora, Veo3) or a human editor/animator.

⸻

Summary / Philosophy (merged)

Soul / Vision — This video exists to show that neighbourhoods can be more than geography: they can be a small, connected family. Start with a warm idea, show small everyday fractures with light comedy, present the simple product fix, then close on tangible human feeling.

Narrative Arc — Vision → Problems (comic vignettes) → Solution (app screens) → Transformation (human montage) → Invitation (tagline).

Audience & Tone — Early-adopter neighbours (people who care about local community). Tone is warm, slightly nerdy, observationally comic in problems, crisp in product explanation, and heartfelt in the emotional close.

Primary Features to show
	1.	Connect (interest tags, quick-match neighbour profiles)
	2.	Activities (recurring local meetups)
	3.	Events (one-off local events like cricket matches)

Small features to flash: Lost & Found; Complaints; SOS emergency; local business cards.

Style arc
	•	Opening: hand-drawn/illustrative neighbourhood (warm pastels).
	•	Problems: modern stick-figure comic animation (thin lines, expressive faces).
	•	Product: clean phone UI mockups (minimal, warm palette).
	•	Transformation: cinematic, real-life/photoreal montage with natural light.

Production & Generator Guidance (for Sora / Veo3)

Art style prompts (use as inputs to generator):
	•	Opening: “hand-sketched neighborhood map, warm pastel palette, gentle pop-in animation, inviting mood”.
	•	Problems: “modern stick-figure animation, thin black strokes, expressive faces, minimal props, comedic timing”.
	•	Product screens: “phone mockup, UI cards sliding, interest tags popping, smooth micro-interactions, shadow & depth”.
	•	Transformation: “candid lifestyle footage, golden-hour lighting, shallow depth of field, natural smiles”.

Color palette: Soft warm greens (#9ec89b), terracotta/orange (#f08a4b), cream (#fff3e0), graphite accents.

Transitions: keep continuity by using morphing transitions where possible: sketch → stick → screen (morph a TV frame into a phone) → live (match color / motion to avoid jump cuts). Use cross-dissolves + subtle parallax.

Assets you (producer) should supply:
	•	Final app screens (PNG or layered PSD).
	•	Logo in vector (SVG).
	•	Brand fonts and primary color hex codes.
	•	Any real photos/videos you want in montage (optional).

Voiceover: single VO (neutral Indian-English, friendly, warm) — 40–50 yrs? No — better: a mid-30s neutral, empathetic tone. Provide emphasis marks in VO script. Pace: ~160–175 wpm for spoken parts; leave micro-pauses as indicated.

Music & SFX:
	•	Track: light, optimistic indie-acoustic bed, tempo ~95 BPM, with a friendly rise under feel montage.
	•	SFX: small comedic pops for bubbles, shuttlecock thwack, car whoosh, UI taps, soft ding for join/signup.

Export-ready instructions for AI generator
	1.	Break the video into the following style segments: (A) Sketch opening, (B) Stick-figure vignettes (4), (C) UI phone sequences (3–4 short shots), (D) Live montage (4–5 shots), (E) Logo + tagline.
2.	For continuity, carry warm color accents across segments; avoid additional motifs that may distract.
	3.	Use pre-lap audio: continue the same music bed across cuts; pre-lap VO where indicated to make cuts smoother.
	4.	Place captions / on-screen short texts as specified in script.

Appendices

Voiceover script (word-for-word, with emphasis & pauses)

	•	“She can teach him… he can teach her… but neither has a clue the other even exists.”
	•	“Both want a game… but end up playing badminton with themselves.”
	•	“They even drive to the same office. Alone. Wasting time, wasting money.”
	•	“Together, they could stretch, play, celebrate. Instead… they sit apart.”
	•	“Nikatam connects neighbours instantly — through shared interests.”
	•	“From daily yoga sessions… to one-time cricket matches.”
	•	“Even local businesses finally get seen — right where it matters most.”

VO performance notes: keep tempo conversational; emphasize the ellipses and the contrast lines (“Instead… they sit apart.”). Small micro-pauses increase emotional weight.

On-screen text & captions
	•	Use sparing on-screen text; prefer visual storytelling. Keep each caption to 2–4 words. Use brand font, medium weight, cream or graphite text depending on background contrast.

SFX (short list for editor)
	•	Sketch pop-in (0.2s)
	•	Cartoon sigh / whoosh for vignettes
	•	Shuttlecock thwack
	•	Car coin-drop ‘ting’
	•	UI tap & slide
	•	SOS heartbeat pulse
	•	Small bell dings for micro-wins

Notes for iterations & AI generator specifics
	•	If you want the video shorter (45s), tighten each vignette to 3.5s and reduce montage time to 10s.
	•	For Sora/Veo3 prompts: paste the per-second blocks as separate shot prompts, ensuring they get style directives (stick-figure for 5–25s, photoreal for 40–55s).
	•	If using synthetic voice, pick a voice with warm midrange and natural prosody; add breath markers in the audio render for authenticity.
