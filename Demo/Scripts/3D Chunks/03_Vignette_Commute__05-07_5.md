NIKATAM — 3D Experiment — Chunk 03: Vignette — Commute

[Visuals]
- Two small cars travel side by side on a quiet, simplified road; distant houses glide by as soft silhouettes.
- Above each car, a diegetic, physical fuel gauge object slowly loses bars; a couple of tiny coin tokens slip out near the wheel and tumble away.
- Drivers briefly glance at their phones, unaware of each other.

[Narrative]
Parallel routes, parallel costs—alone together, inches apart.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Lateral tracking move with gentle parallax; camera height remains steady.
- Flat daylight with soft skylight fill; very soft reflections; no harsh contrast.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Two small cars drive side by side on a quiet road while distant homes slide by as soft silhouettes. Each car shows a physical fuel gauge object that slowly loses bars; a couple of small coin tokens tumble away near a wheel. Drivers briefly glance at their phones, never noticing each other. Use a smooth lateral tracking move and flat daylight. Keep vehicle motion physically plausible, wheels grounded without sliding, and avoid geometry clipping or facial distortion. No text or UI."
