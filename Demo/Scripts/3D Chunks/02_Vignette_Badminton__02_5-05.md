NIKATAM — 3D Experiment — Chunk 02: Vignette — Badminton

[Visuals]
- A vertical split composition shows two small apartments, one above the other. Each room is softly lit with warm practicals, sparse props, and a lived‑in feel.
- In the top room, a player stands slightly right of center; in the bottom, a player stands slightly left. Each hits the shuttlecock once; it brushes the wall and ends up on the floor. Actions are offset so they feel unsynchronized.
- The environment breathes: tiny dust motes in the light, a delicate curtain sway.

[Narrative]
Close, yet separate. Two evenings unfolding alone, the game unfinished.

[Camera / Lighting]
- One continuous, slow zoom‑out that lightly reveals more of both rooms. Keep the move smooth and centered.
- Warm interior bulbs with soft bounce; dim ambient fill; very soft contact shadows.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Vertical split composition shows two apartments stacked top and bottom. Each player hits a shuttlecock once; it brushes the wall and rests on the floor, with actions offset so they are not in sync. Use warm practical lighting and a single continuous slow zoom‑out. Ensure clean character rigs, natural cloth motion, collision‑free contacts, and stable faces without distortion. Keep physics plausible and the camera steady. No text or UI."
