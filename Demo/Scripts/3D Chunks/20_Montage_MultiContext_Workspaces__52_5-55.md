NIKATAM — 3D — Chunk 20: Montage — Multi‑Context Workspaces

[Visuals]
- A small group remains centered while the background signage swaps smoothly through three contexts as clear visual signifiers: Society → Company → College. A phone ‘Workspace’ selector (as a shape) is tapped to cycle contexts.

[Narrative]
It works everywhere—switch workspace, same belonging.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Locked, centered composition with subtle background parallax; bright, neutral light.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Keep a small group centered while the environment signage swaps through three contexts (Society, Company, College) using clear, text‑free visual signifiers. A simple ‘Workspace’ selector shape in the phone nav is tapped to cycle contexts. Ensure smooth transitions, stable characters, collision‑free interactions, and a steady camera. No text or logos."
