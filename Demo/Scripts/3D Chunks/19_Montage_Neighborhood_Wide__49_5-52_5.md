NIKATAM — 3D — Chunk 19: Montage — Neighbourhood Wide

[Visuals]
- A warm wide view of the neighbourhood shows small clusters: chatting neighbours, a tiny yoga group, two playing catch—spaced with generous breathing room.

[Narrative]
The neighbourhood begins to feel like family again.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Slow, gentle rise with subtle parallax across rooftops and trees; late‑day warmth.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Present a wide neighbourhood view with several small clusters: chatting, a tiny yoga group, and two playing catch. Keep layout uncluttered with clear separation between clusters. Maintain realistic scale, stable characters, and physically plausible motion; steady camera with a gentle crane rise; warm late‑day light. No text or logos."
