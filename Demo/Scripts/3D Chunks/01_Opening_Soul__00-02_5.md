NIKATAM — 3D Experiment — Chunk 01: Opening Soul

[Visuals]
- A quiet neighbourhood street assembles itself like a delicate miniature: small homes, plants, and fence lines ease into place.
- The sun peeks over rooftops, sending soft volumetric rays through light morning haze.
- Surfaces feel handcrafted—matte walls, soft clay‑like roof tiles, paper‑thin leaves.

[Narrative]
Begin with warmth and possibility—the neighbourhood wakes, calm and hopeful.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Slow, graceful dolly forward with gentle parallax; keep the horizon stable and the motion unhurried.
- Warm morning key with soft bounce; global illumination and very soft bloom.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. A small neighbourhood street calmly assembles—miniature houses, plants, and fences easing into place. The sun peeks above rooftops with soft volumetric light through a light haze. Use a slow forward dolly and shallow depth‑of‑field. Maintain realistic proportions and physically plausible motion; keep the camera stable and free of jitter. Avoid distorted faces, mesh clipping, or stretched geometry. No text, no logos, no UI."
