Strangers become teammates—shared effort, shared joy.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. At a local cricket ground, show a decisive moment and a quick team celebration: two neighbours meet in a crisp high‑five with visible smiles; a small group cheer around them. Keep character rigs stable, hands collision‑free, and ball/bat physics plausible. Use a steady handheld sideline look with shallow depth‑of‑field and warm light. No text or logos."
