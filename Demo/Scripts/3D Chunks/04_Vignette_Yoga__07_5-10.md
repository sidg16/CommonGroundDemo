NIKATAM — 3D Experiment — Chunk 04: Vignette — Yoga

[Visuals]
- A tidy 2×3 grid of neighbourhood windows on one building facade. In each window, a person attempts a simple pose on a mat.
- Two wobble slightly and catch their balance; one glances outward, hears life beyond the glass, then resumes the pose.
- Interiors are sparse and warm: a mat, a plant, a soft lamp glow.

[Narrative]
Six little moments of trying alone—close, but not yet together.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Locked facade framing with a gentle, organic micro‑drift; small tilt or sway from a handheld feel.
- Evening window light mixed with warm interior lamps; soft reflections on glass; gentle bloom.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. One building facade shows a clean 2×3 grid of windows, each framing a person attempting a simple yoga pose on a mat. Two windows show a small wobble; one person glances outward briefly, then returns to the pose. Use warm window light and sparse interiors. Keep character rigs stable with natural joints and clean cloth motion; avoid facial distortion, finger fusion, or mesh clipping. Subtle handheld micro‑drift is okay; no text or UI."
