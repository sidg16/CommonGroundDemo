[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Children share a joyful playdate in a small balcony or courtyard—laughter, a quick high‑five, simple toys between them. Include a brief insert of a shared workbook or puzzle with heads close together. Keep performances natural, faces stable, hands collision‑free, and motion physically plausible. Use shallow depth‑of‑field, warm light, and a steady handheld feel. No text or logos."
