[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. A phone displays a minimal feed of activity cards as simple shapes suggesting a yoga group and a badminton meetup. A join control gently pulses and the list scrolls smoothly. Keep shapes large and readable, motion smooth, and composition uncluttered. Maintain realistic finger interactions, collision‑free touches, and steady camera. No text or logos."
