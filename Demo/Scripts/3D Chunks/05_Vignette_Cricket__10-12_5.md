NIKATAM — 3D Experiment — Chunk 05: Vignette — Cricket

[Visuals]
- Option A: A single living room with a large TV frame showing a simplified broadcast moment. The camera eases back to reveal more homes in a gentle miniature neighbourhood, each with a lone viewer on a small couch watching the same moment.
- Option B: A quiet local ground with one person fumbling a simple catch, then a small breath of deflation before a hopeful look outward.
- Keep the world uncluttered and readable.

[Narrative]
Desire for team play, yet alone—longing for a way to join in.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Option A: One continuous pull‑back from intimate interior to broader miniature street, avoiding cuts.
- Option B: Medium single‑subject framing with a small, empathetic push‑in.
- Soft, flat daylight with mild bounce; gentle ambient occlusion; no harsh contrast.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Option A: Begin in a cozy living room watching a simplified cricket moment on a TV; slowly pull back until multiple neighbouring homes appear, each with a single viewer watching the same moment. Option B: A quiet local ground with one person fumbling a simple catch, then a small breath of deflation and a hopeful glance outward. Maintain realistic proportions, stable faces, collision‑free hands, and physically plausible motion. Keep the pull‑back smooth and avoid geometry stretching or clipping. No text or logos."
