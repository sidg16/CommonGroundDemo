[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Pull back to a miniature 3D neighbourhood map; at the center, reveal the NIKATAM wordmark, morphing from a sketch‑like look to a clean, crisp 3D mark. Keep geometry stable with no stretching, faces clean if visible, and the camera steady. Avoid extra overlays; present only the logo reveal."
