NIKATAM — 3D — Chunk 12: Problem — Micro‑Business, No Hyperlocal Reach

[Visuals]
- A quiet home micro‑business scene—small bakery counter or craft table—without customer traffic; nearby phone shows indistinct unread messages (no readable names).

[Narrative]
Present, but unseen—right here.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Static, minimal composition; soft indoor light slightly dimmer than usual.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. A quiet home micro‑business like a small bakery counter sits without customer traffic. A nearby phone shows indistinct unread messages (avoid readable names). Keep the frame minimal and tasteful, with realistic proportions, stable faces, and no geometry clipping. Use soft indoor light and a steady camera. No text or logos."
