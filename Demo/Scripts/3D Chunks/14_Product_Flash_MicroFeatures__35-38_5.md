[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Present a minimal icon strip: SOS (calm pulse), Lost & Found (pin drops), Complaints (small shake), Notices (paper pin settles). Keep icons simple and readable, motion clean and snappy, and the frame uncluttered. Maintain physically believable motion, no geometry clipping, and a steady camera. No text or labels."
