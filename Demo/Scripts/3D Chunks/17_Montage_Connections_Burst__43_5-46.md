Connect by interests, hobbies, location, your company, your kids—just a tap away.

[Camera / Lighting]

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. A phone is centered while simple chip shapes orbit to suggest different ways to connect (interests, hobbies, location, company, kids, wants). On tap, chips snap toward the phone. Keep motion smooth, shapes readable, and frame uncluttered. Maintain collision‑free motion, stable objects, and a steady camera. No text or labels."
