[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Two quick beats: 1) the first shared hit of a badminton doubles rally between neighbours with a small shared glance at contact; 2) inside a shared car ride to the same office, seated side‑by‑side with seat belts on, happily chatting as the city drifts by through the windows. Maintain natural faces, clean hand/racket contacts, plausible shuttle physics, collision‑free interactions, and a steady camera without jitter. Keep motion grounded and interior reflections subtle. No text or UI."
