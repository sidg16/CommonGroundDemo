NIKATAM — 3D — Chunk 18: Montage — Micro‑Wins

[Visuals]
- Cross‑dissolve mini‑montage: a home chef hands a pastry to a neighbour customer; a tutor guides a tiny living‑room mini‑class; a lost dog reunion with a warm hug.

[Narrative]
Week by week—skills swapped, activities done together, rides shared, classes formed, customers found.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Slow, gentle push‑ins; close‑ups on hands and faces; warm, natural indoor light.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Show three small community wins: a pastry handoff from a home chef, a tutor guiding a tiny mini‑class, and a lost dog reunion with a warm hug. Keep performances natural, faces stable, hands collision‑free, and motion physically plausible. Use shallow depth‑of‑field, warm indoor light, and smooth cross‑dissolves. No text or logos."
