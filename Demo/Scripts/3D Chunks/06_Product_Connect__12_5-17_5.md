[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. A phone centered in frame shows large tag chips (as simple shapes) and a small match badge. A finger taps a connect control; a friendly modal appears with two neighbour profile cards and a clear ‘say hello’ control as a shape. Keep UI shapes minimal and legible, with smooth motion and a gentle push‑in. Maintain clean, collision‑free interactions, stable faces, and no mesh clipping. Camera stays steady; no text or actual UI copy."
