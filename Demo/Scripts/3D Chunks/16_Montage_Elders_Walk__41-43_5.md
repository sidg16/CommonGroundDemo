NIKATAM — 3D — Chunk 16: Montage — Elders Walk

[Visuals]
- Three gentle beats: elders tap cards and share a light chuckle; a small laughing‑therapy circle; two elders walk side by side sharing a thermos.

[Narrative]
Elders live side by side—safer, seen.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Table close‑up → medium circle → slow sidewalk walk; shallow focus; soft daylight with a light rim.

[Generator Prompt]
"Default cinematic 3D animation. Show elders in three soft beats: a card‑table chuckle, a small laughing‑therapy circle, and a sidewalk walk sharing a thermos. Keep performances gentle and caring; maintain stable faces, natural joints, collision‑free hands, and physically plausible motion. Use soft daylight and a steady camera. No text or logos."
