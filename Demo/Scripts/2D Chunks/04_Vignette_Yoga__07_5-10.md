NIKATAM — Chunk 04: Vignette — Yoga

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle on warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly graphite lines; soft colored‑pencil accents; no gradients; no baked text, logos, or UI.

[Visuals]
- Six stacked house windows: each stick-person attempts an awkward yoga pose.
- Quick wobble gag on two windows; one peeks toward off-screen (neighbour sounds), then resumes pose.
- Keep lines thin; minimal props (mat texture only) to set up later mat-to-UI transition.

[Narrative]
Six small windows show solo yoga attempts. Two wobble a little; one person glances outward before trying again. The arrangement feels tidy but distant, hinting that together would be easier.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Camera: stacked grid; slight handheld micro‑breathe.
- Lighting: flat clean; stick-figure palette.

[Generator Prompt]
“Doodle animation. A tidy 2×3 grid of windows, each framing a stick‑figure on a small mat. Two figures wobble gently; one turns the head outward for a moment, then returns to the pose. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly; fills are soft colored‑pencil; background remains minimal and calm. Keep the camera steady with a faint hand‑drawn breath; avoid clutter and keep lots of breathing space. No text, no logos, no UI.”
