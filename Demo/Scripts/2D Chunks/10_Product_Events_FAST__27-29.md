"Doodle animation. A hand‑drawn phone displays a minimal event card as simple shapes hinting at a local cricket meetup. A join control is tapped and a tiny celebratory indicator appears. Keep the motion quick and clear; lines thin and wobbly, fills soft colored‑pencil, background uncluttered; no text or logos."
