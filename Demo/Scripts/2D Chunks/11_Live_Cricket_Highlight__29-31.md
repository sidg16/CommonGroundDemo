[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream background; thin, gently wobbly lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; no gradients; no baked text.

[Visuals]
- A local cricket ground moment: a clean wicket or a sharp fielding play, followed by a quick team celebration—two neighbours meet in a crisp high‑five and a small group cheer.
- Keep framing tight on hands and faces to catch joy and contact.

[Narrative]
Joining an event turns strangers into teammates—shared effort, shared joy.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Handheld‑like sideline angle with shallow focus; late‑afternoon warmth.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. At a local cricket ground, show a decisive moment followed by a quick team celebration: two neighbours meet in a crisp high‑five with visible smiles, a small group cheer around them. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly, fills soft colored‑pencil, background warm cream and uncluttered. Keep it joyful and free of text or logos."
