NIKATAM — Chunk 19: Montage — Neighbourhood Wide

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; no gradients; no baked text.

[Visuals]
- A wide establishing doodle of the neighbourhood shows small clusters in motion: a few chatting neighbours, a micro‑yoga group, two playing catch.
- Maintain generous negative space so clusters read clearly.

[Narrative]
And the neighbourhood begins to feel like family again.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Slow, gentle rise with subtle parallax; late‑day warmth.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. A warm, wide view of the neighbourhood shows several small clusters—chatting, a tiny yoga group, two playing catch—spaced with plenty of breathing room. Keep the mood welcoming and uncluttered; lines thin and slightly wobbly; fills soft colored‑pencil; no text or logos."
