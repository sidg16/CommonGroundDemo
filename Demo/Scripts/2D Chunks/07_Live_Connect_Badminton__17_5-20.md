NIKATAM — Chunk 07: Live — Connect (Badminton)

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream background; thin, gently wobbly graphite lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; no gradients or baked text.

[Visuals]
- Two quick beats create a human payoff: first, the very first shared hit of a badminton doubles rally as neighbours lean in and the shuttle kisses strings; second, a carpool door opens and a friendly nod is exchanged as they get in.
- Keep faces simple and open; include a small shared glance in the rally beat.

[Narrative]
Connection turns into action—play together, travel together.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Close, intimate framing with gentle hand‑drawn jitter; neutral soft light; clean background.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. Show two quick beats: 1) the first shared hit of a badminton doubles rally between neighbours with a tiny shared glance at contact; 2) a carpool door opening and a warm nod as they get in together. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly, fills are soft colored‑pencil, background warm cream and uncluttered. Keep it human and text‑free."
