[Camera / Lighting]

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. A hand‑sketched neighbourhood street gradually appears from left to right on warm cream paper. A few small buildings pop in gently, then a simple sun rises above the rooftops. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly; fills are soft colored‑pencil; background remains minimal with lots of breathing space. Keep the camera calm and subtle, with a faint hand‑drawn parallax feel. No text, no logos, no UI."
