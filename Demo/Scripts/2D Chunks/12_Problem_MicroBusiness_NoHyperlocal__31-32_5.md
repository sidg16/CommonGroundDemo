NIKATAM — Chunk 12: Problem — Micro‑Business, No Hyperlocal Reach

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream paper; thin, slightly wobbly graphite lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; subdued mood; no baked text.

[Visuals]
- A quiet home micro‑business scene: a small bakery counter or craft table with no customer traffic. A nearby phone lies face‑up with indistinct unread messages (no legible names).
- Keep the space simple and tasteful—empty, not gloomy.

[Narrative]
Local sellers are present but unseen where it matters most—right here.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Static composition; soft natural indoor light, slightly dimmer than usual.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. Show a quiet home micro‑business like a small bakery counter without customers. A phone is nearby with indistinct unread messages (avoid readable names). Keep the composition minimal and subdued; lines thin and wobbly; fills soft colored‑pencil; no text or logos in‑frame."
