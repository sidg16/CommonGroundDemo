[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. A hand‑drawn phone displays a clean feed of activity cards as simple shapes (for example: a morning yoga group, a badminton meetup). A join control gently pulses and the list scrolls smoothly. Keep the UI minimal, roomy, and readable; lines are thin and wobbly; fills are soft colored‑pencil; no text or logos baked in."
