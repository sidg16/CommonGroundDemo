NIKATAM — Chunk 13: Product — Businesses

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; minimal UI shapes; no baked text or logos.

[Visuals]
- A split phone UI shows two simple business cards as shapes: a local bakery on the left and a tuition service on the right.
- A book control is tapped on the bakery card; a friendly confirmation tick appears. On the tuition side, a message control is highlighted to suggest another path.
- Keep everything clean and balanced with generous spacing.

[Narrative]
Give micro‑businesses a storefront in the neighbourhood—be known, be booked, and grow.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Static phone framing; soft micro‑parallax within cards; soft studio‑like light.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. A hand‑drawn phone shows two business cards as simple shapes—bakery on the left, tuition on the right. Tap a book control on the bakery card and show a friendly confirmation tick; on the tuition side, highlight a message control. Keep the UI minimal, spacious, and readable; lines thin and slightly wobbly; fills soft colored‑pencil; no text or logos."
