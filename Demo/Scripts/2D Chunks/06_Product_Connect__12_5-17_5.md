NIKATAM — Chunk 06: Product — Connect Feature

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle on warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly graphite lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; minimal shadows; no gradients; no text, logos, or UI copy.

[Visuals]
- A doodled phone sits centered on a calm background.
- The home view shows large, simple interest tag chips as shapes (for example: sport, wellness, learning) and a small match badge shape.
- A finger taps a clear connect control; a friendly modal appears with two neighbour profile cards and a simple “say hello” control represented as a shape.
- Keep shapes big and breathable; avoid clutter.

[Narrative]
Connection feels immediate and friendly. The appearance of the modal reads as a small exhale—neighbours are within reach.

[Camera / Lighting]
- A gentle push‑in as the modal appears; tiny hand‑drawn pops on chips and cards.
- Soft, even lighting; minimal background; subtle pencil shadowing.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. A simple hand‑drawn phone sits centered on a quiet background. On the home view, large tag chips (clear shapes) and a small match badge are visible. A finger taps a connect control; a friendly modal with two neighbour profile cards appears, each with a ‘say hello’ control shown as a shape. Keep the composition minimal with generous breathing space; motion is smooth and gentle with small hand‑drawn pops. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly; fills are soft colored‑pencil. No text, no logos, no UI copy."
