NIKATAM — Chunk 20: Montage — Multi‑Context Workspaces

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream background; thin, gently wobbly lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; minimal UI shapes; no baked text.

[Visuals]
- A small group remains centered while the background signage swaps smoothly through three contexts: Your Society → Your Company → Your College.
- A phone top nav shows a ‘Workspace’ selector; a tap cycles the context.

[Narrative]
It works everywhere—your society, your company, your college—switch workspace, same belonging.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Locked, centered composition with subtle background parallax; bright, neutral light.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. Keep the same small group centered while the environment signage swaps through three contexts: Your Society, Your Company, Your College. A simple ‘Workspace’ selector in the phone nav is tapped to cycle contexts. Keep shapes minimal, motion smooth, and frames free of baked text or logos; thin wobbly lines and soft colored‑pencil fills."
