NIKATAM — Chunk 18: Montage — Micro‑Wins

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream background; thin, gently wobbly lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; no gradients; no baked text.

[Visuals]
- Cross‑dissolve mini‑montage: a home chef hands a pastry to a neighbour customer; a tutor runs a tiny living‑room mini‑class; a lost dog reunion with a happy hug.
- Optionally echo small feature ticks subtly in the corner (a tiny ‘hello’, ‘joined’, or ‘booked’ mark) as visual motifs, without text.

[Narrative]
Week by week—skills swapped, activities done together, rides shared, classes formed, customers found.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Slow, gentle push‑ins; close‑ups on hands and faces; warm natural indoor light.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. Show three small community wins in a cross‑dissolve montage: a pastry handoff from a home chef, a tutor guiding a tiny mini‑class, and a lost dog reunion with a warm hug. Keep scenes simple and heartfelt; lines thin and slightly wobbly; fills soft colored‑pencil; warm cream background; no text or logos."
