NIKATAM — Chunk 16: Montage — Elders Walk

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream background; thin, gently wobbly lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; no gradients; no baked text.

[Visuals]
- A gentle trio of moments: elders tap cards on a small table and share a light chuckle; cut to a small laughing‑therapy circle; end with two elders walking side by side sharing a thermos.
- Close on hands and relaxed expressions; simple props only.

[Narrative]
Elders live side by side—safer, seen.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Table close‑up → medium circle → slow walk; shallow focus; soft daylight with a light rim.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. Show elders in three soft beats: card game chuckle, a small laughing‑therapy circle, and a sidewalk walk sharing a thermos. Keep the mood caring and unhurried; lines thin and slightly wobbly; fills soft colored‑pencil; warm cream backdrop; no text or logos."
