[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. A hand‑drawn phone is centered on warm cream. Around it, simple chip shapes orbit to suggest different ways to connect (interests, hobbies, location, company, kids, wants). On tap, chips snap toward the phone. Keep it smooth, minimal, and text‑free; lines thin and wobbly; fills soft colored‑pencil."
