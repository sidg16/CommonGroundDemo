NIKATAM — Chunk 22: Closing — Tagline, Waitlist, Fade

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle; warm cream background; thin, gently wobbly lines; soft colored‑pencil fills; clean frames; no extra baked text beyond the visual tagline and CTA shapes.

[Visuals]
- Hold the doodled logo/map from the previous shot.
- The doodled wordmark gently morphs into a clean vector‑like drawing with crisper edges and a soft professional glow.
- Below it, reveal a simple visual‑only tagline as shapes and a clear CTA button shape suggesting “Join waitlist.”
- Finish with a gentle fade.

[Narrative]
Coming soon to your neighbourhood. Join the waitlist.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Locked composition with a calm micro‑drift; soft glow that settles when the logo cleans up.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. Hold on the doodled ‘NIKATAM’ map/mark from the prior shot. Morph the mark into a clean vector‑like drawing with crisp edges and a soft professional glow. Beneath it, reveal a simple visual tagline and a clear CTA button shape suggesting ‘Join waitlist’. Keep everything minimal and text‑free; lines thin and slightly wobbly, fills soft colored‑pencil, warm cream background."
