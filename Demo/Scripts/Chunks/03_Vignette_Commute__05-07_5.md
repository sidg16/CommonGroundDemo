NIKATAM — Chunk 03: Vignette — Commute (0:05–0:07.5)

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle on warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly graphite lines; light colored‑pencil accents only; no gradients; no baked text, logos, or UI.

 
[Visuals]
- Side-by-side simple road with repeating houses; two cars driving parallel.
- Fuel meters above each car drop quickly; tiny coins tumble out.

[Narrative]
Two neighbours commute in parallel on a simple road. Both glance at their phones, unaware of each other. Above each car, a doodled fuel meter loses bars while a couple of tiny coins tumble away. Houses in the distance are simple, faint silhouettes. The scene feels routine and a little empty.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Camera: lateral tracking with slight parallax.
- Lighting: flat daylight; simple shapes; no logos.

[Generator Prompt]
“Doodle animation. A simple two‑lane road with lightly sketched houses drifting by in the distance. Two small cars travel side by side; inside each, a stick‑figure driver glances at a phone. Above each car, a minimal fuel meter loses bars while a couple of tiny coin doodles fall away. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly; fills are soft colored‑pencil; background stays uncluttered. Keep the camera gently drifting along the road; keep everything calm and understated. No text, no logos, no UI.”
