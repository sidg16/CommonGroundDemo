NIKATAM — Chunk 02: Vignette — Badminton

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle on warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly graphite lines; soft colored‑pencil accents; no gradients; no baked text, logos, or UI.

[Visuals]
- Vertical stacked split-frame (top/bottom): two simple rooms, one above the other.
- Single slow zoom‑out shot for the entire clip. Each player plays alone and hits the shuttlecock once; it hits the wall and falls to the floor. Actions are unsynchronized between panels to imply separation.

[Composition]
- Top panel shows a simple room with the player slightly right of center; a tiny plant sits to the right. Bottom panel mirrors this with the player slightly left and a tiny plant to the left. The shuttlecock in each panel appears near the wall, then is seen resting on the floor by the end. Keep backgrounds minimal and roomy.

[Beat Flow]
- First the top player hits and we see a couple of tiny impact lines by the wall as the shuttle begins to drop. A moment later, the bottom player hits; the shuttle drops there too. Both end with a small, quiet hold.
- The camera performs one gentle, continuous slow zoom‑out across the whole shot.


[Narrative]
Two neighbours, one above the other, are so close yet unaware. Each plays a little game alone; each shuttle taps the wall and drops. The slow zoom reveals the small ache of separation without turning heavy.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Camera: locked split; subtle hand‑drawn drift; a single gentle slow zoom‑out over the whole shot.
- Lighting: clean flat; minimal props to keep focus on action.

[Generator Prompt]
"Doodle animation. A vertical stacked split shows two simple rooms, one above the other. In the top room, the player stands slightly right of center; in the bottom room, the player stands slightly left. Each hits the shuttlecock once—it nudges the wall and then we see it resting on the floor by the end. The actions happen a moment apart so they do not feel in sync. Add a couple of tiny hand‑drawn impact lines near each wall and very small fall marks by the shuttlecock. Keep the camera calm with one gentle slow zoom‑out over the whole shot. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly; fills are soft colored‑pencil; backgrounds remain minimal with lots of breathing space. No text, no logos, no UI."
