NIKATAM — Chunk 05: Vignette — Cricket

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle on warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly graphite lines; soft colored‑pencil accents; no gradients; no baked text, logos, or UI.

 
[Visuals]
- Single large TV frame shows cricket; multiple tiny viewers on couches feel isolated.
- Alternative option: one stick-figure at a local ground fumbles a solo catch; brief deflate.
- Keep composition simple for a fast morph to the Event card.

[Narrative]
We see the desire to play together, yet feel alone. Either a big TV frame shows a simplified cricket broadcast while several tiny single viewers sit far apart on small couches, or we glimpse one person on a quiet ground fumbling a simple catch. The moment is light and a bit wistful, not heavy.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Camera: static TV frame with subtle push-in; or single‑subject medium shot at ground.
- Lighting: flat clean; stick-figure style.


[Generator Prompt]
“Hand‑drawn doodle animation on warm cream paper (#fff3e0). Thin, gently wobbly graphite lines (#0E1012), soft colored‑pencil fills; no gradients; no baked text or logos. 16:9, 1920×1080, 24 fps.

Scene:
1) Start inside a single living room. Center frame: a large hand‑drawn TV rectangle shows a simple cricket moment (pitch lines, stumps, a ball arc). One stick‑figure sits on a small couch facing the TV. Props minimal (tiny plant or window outline), very light.
2) Smooth pull‑back: the view pulls back to reveal the house exterior, then continues to a tidy grid of houses arranged 5 columns by 2 rows (10 total). Inside each house, mirror the same setup: one stick‑figure on a small couch watching the same simple cricket moment on a TV.
3) End: hold briefly on the full 5×2 grid to clearly convey ‘alone together’.

Style & motion:
- Lines thin and slightly squiggly; pencil texture only where needed for readability.
- Single continuous camera pull‑back (no cuts, no shakes).
- Flat, clean lighting; uncluttered background; strong negative space.

Timing (guide): total 2.5–3.0s; ~1.2s on the single room before pull‑back; ~1.3–1.8s to complete reveal and brief hold.

Avoid: photoreal elements, gradients, complex textures, any text/UI/branding in-scene.”
