NIKATAM — Chunk 05: Vignette — Cricket

[Style]
Hand‑drawn doodle on warm cream paper; thin, gently wobbly graphite lines; soft colored‑pencil accents; no gradients; no baked text, logos, or UI.

 
[Visuals]
- Single large TV frame shows cricket; multiple tiny viewers on couches feel isolated.
- Alternative option: one stick-figure at a local ground fumbles a solo catch; brief deflate.
- Keep composition simple for a fast morph to the Event card.

[Narrative]
We see the desire to play together, yet feel alone. Either a big TV frame shows a simplified cricket broadcast while several tiny single viewers sit far apart on small couches, or we glimpse one person on a quiet ground fumbling a simple catch. The moment is light and a bit wistful, not heavy.

[Camera / Lighting]
- Camera: static TV frame with subtle push-in; or single‑subject medium shot at ground.
- Lighting: flat clean; stick-figure style.



[Generator Prompt]
“Doodle animation. Option A: a large hand‑drawn TV frame in the center shows a simple cricket scene (pitch lines, a ball arc). Around it, several small couch silhouettes each seat one stick‑figure viewer, spaced so they feel apart. Option B: a small open ground with a single stick‑figure reaching for the ball and just missing it; the ball falls nearby. Lines are thin and slightly wobbly; fills are soft colored‑pencil; keep the background uncluttered and quiet. Hold the moment long enough to register the gentle irony—wanting a team, sitting alone. No text, no logos, no UI.”
